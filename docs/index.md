# WorkRight HRIS documentation index

This directory collects operational runbooks, architectural notes, and deployment checklists that support the WorkRight HRIS platform. Start with the sections below to locate the information you need:

- [Azure deployment checklist](./azure-deployment.md) – Infrastructure, configuration, and rollout guidance for deploying the API to Azure App Service or Azure Container Apps.
- [Azure infrastructure template](../infra/azure/README.md) – Bicep template and parameters for provisioning the required Azure resources without subnet tag validation errors.
- [`adr/`](./adr/) – Architecture decision records that capture historical reasoning behind significant technical choices.

When adding new documentation, update this index so the most relevant runbooks remain easy to discover.
